For this lab, we created a program that uses an accelerometer
to drive a car up and down a ramp. Using an LCD display, we
tell the car to either drive up or down a ramp after positioning
it sideways on said ramp. The car will either go up or down depending
on the input and will stop driving when the accelerometer is reading
zero for the x and y values, telling the car it is off the ramp.
