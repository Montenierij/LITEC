This project was about using PID's for a drone on a spinning
turntable that had a low coefficent of friction. Using the motors
for the drone, we had to set a direction on the compass for the
drone to face and the left and right motors had to work together
to get the drone to face the compass value and stop moving once there.
The challenge for this program was getting the drone to not go into a
feedback loop too intense that the drone starts just spinning in circles.
